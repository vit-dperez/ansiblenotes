# Ansible

## Why Ansible?

- Its a powerful IT automation tool that we can learn quickly, yet powerful enough to automate even the most complex deployments.

- Scripts were replaced with Ansible Playbooks.

- Simple use case: Ansible is helful when we got a set of servers and we want to restart them in a particular order (shutdown webservers first, then dbs servers and start dbs first and then the web servers), we can write an Ansible Playbook to get this done in a matter of minutes.

- Complex use case: we want to manage a private and public cloud (Amazon and VMWare) and we want to configure applications, and setting up communication between them, manage files, setting firewall-rules, etc.
